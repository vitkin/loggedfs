LoggedFS-CSV 0.1

Introduction:
=============
This is a fork from LoggedFS 0.5 from Rémi Flament <rflament@laposte.net>
You can find the original project here: http://loggedfs.sourceforge.net/
See also RLog http://www.arg0.net/rlog for more details on the logging library used for the output.

It monitors all the filesystem actions for a given folder and subfolders.

Modifications:
==============
The original project has been modified in order to generate a CSV output for all the actions.

Other modifications:
- Removal of filename and line number in output.
- Display of the full command line.
- Display of the PPID.
- Separation between STDERR for messages and STDOUT for the CSV.

Usage:
======
loggedfs [-h] | [-l log-file] [-c config-file] [-f] [-p] [-e] /directory-mountpoint
Type 'man loggedfs' for more details

For example:
# loggedfs -fp -c loggedfs.xml /folder-to-monitor > loggedfs.csv

Configuration:
==============
Use an XML file for the following filters:

* extension: specify the file extension to filter based on regular expression.

* uid: specify the UID or * for all.

* action: specify the action to filter based on regular expression.

  The possible actions are:
  - getattr - Get Attributes
  - access
  - readlink - Read Link
  - readdir - Read Directory
  - mkfile - Make an inode for a File - S_IFREG (normal file creation)
  - mkfifo - Make a FIFO - S_IFFIFO (FIFO creation)
  - mkchar - Make an inode for a character device
  - mknod - Make an inode
  - mkdir - Make Directory
  - unlink - Remove hard link.
  - rmdir - Remove Directory
  - symlink - Create Symbolic Link
  - rename - Rename
  - link - Create hard link
  - chmod - Change Mode
  - chown - Change Owner
  - truncate
  - utime - Update Time
  - utimens - Update Time in Nano Seconds.
  - open-readonly
  - open-writeonly
  - open-readwrite
  - open
  - read-request
  - read
  - write-request
  - write
  - statfs - File System Status

* retname: specify the return name to filter based on regular expression.
  (Actually the possible return names can be either SUCCESS or FAILURE)

Requirements:
=============
Packages required for building the project:

- On RHEL / CentOS / Fedora or equivalent:
  # yum install libxml2-devel pcre-devel rlog-devel fuse-devel gcc-c++

- On Debian and equivalent:
  # apt-get install libxml2-dev libpcre3-dev librlog-dev libfuse-dev g++

Installation:
=============
# make && make install

Notes:
======
- The CSV uses the tabulation ('\t') as the delimiter.

- The header of the CSV is:
<Time>,Action,Path,Mode,From,To,To UID,To GID,To User Name,To Group Name,Size,Offset,Result,UID,PID,PPID,Command Line

- The "Mode" field is actually the value of the st_mode as described in the man page of lstat.

- If a command line includes new lines or tabulation (like for AWK calls),
  then they are respectively replaced by "~N~" or "~T~".
